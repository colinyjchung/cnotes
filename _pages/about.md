**As a copywriter and consultant:** I've hired, trained, and written direct response copy for over 15 years in the nutraceutical, financial publishing, and creator space. Clients include Agora, Jim Kwik, and Brian Tracy. Funnels I've written and consulted on has generated over $250M in direct revenue. Between 2014-2020, I was the lead teacher and coach for John Carlton's "Simple Writing System". I've built, managed, and trained copy teams at six different companies.

Based in the suburbs of Vancouver B.C., I'm a father of three monsters, I speak pop culture fluently, and I'm currently obsessed with 16th C. history (the Renaissance & Reformation) as research for a fiction project.
