Hello, I'm Colin Y.J. Chung. 

Professionally, I am...
* Head of Copy Operations at Tried and True Media, a FB/YT ad agency with over $100M/yr ad spend, where I build SOPs, training, and manage a team of copywriters.
* The editor of [_Battlefield Briefs_](https://battlefieldbriefs.com), a newsletter for Veteran Service Organizations, helping veterans avoid legal traps and get disability benefits.
* Co-founder of [Plural Healthcare](http://pluralhealthcare.com), an IOP mental health facility in St. Louis. We help people get back on their feet with advanced group therapy.

Based in the suburbs of Vancouver B.C., I'm a father of three monsters, I speak pop culture fluently, and sneak in moments whenever I can to write [fiction](http://jinnzhong.com).

## As a Copywriter and Consultant 

I've hired, trained, and written direct response copy for over 15 years in the nutraceutical, financial publishing, and creator space. Some of my clients include Agora Financial, Truegenics, Pineapple, Reboot Marketing, Weiss Research, Investing Daily, Mike Koenigs, Ava Jane Kitchens, Brian Tracy, and Jim Kwik. Funnels, VSLs, and webinars I've written (and consulted on) have driven an estimated $250 million total in direct sales.

Between 2014-2020, I was the primary coach for John Carlton's _Simple Writing System_, a cohort-based copywriting course. I've trained hundreds of business owners, entrepreneurs, and freelancers how to write direct response copy. I've also recruited, built, and managed copy teams at six different companies. I've had titles like "Copy Chief", "Copy Coach", and "Director of Copy".

I'm currently "Head of Copy Operations" at Tried and True Media.
