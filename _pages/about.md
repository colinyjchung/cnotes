Hi, I'm Colin Y.J. Chung. 

I'm "Head of Copy Operations" at Tried and True Media, the editor of [_Battlefield Briefs_](https://battlefieldbriefs.com), a newsletter for Veteran Service Organizations helping disabled veterans appeal the V.A., and co-founder of [Plural Healthcare](http://pluralhealthcare.com), an intensive outpatient program (IOP) facility.

_OMFG_, that's a lot of gobblygook, isn't it? Here's what it actually means:

* I build systems, training, and processes to "tame the chaos" at an ad agency
* I show disabled veterans how to avoid legal traps and get disability benefits
* My mental health facility helps people get back on their feet with intense 3-4X/week group therapy

Based in the suburbs of Vancouver B.C., I'm a father of three monsters, I speak pop culture fluently, and sneak in moments whenever I can to write [fiction](http://jinnzhong.com).

**As a copywriter and consultant:** I've hired, trained, and written direct response copy for over 15 years in the nutraceutical, financial publishing, and creator space. Clients include Agora, Jim Kwik, and Brian Tracy. Funnels I've written and consulted on has generated over $250M in direct revenue. Between 2014-2020, I was the lead teacher and coach for John Carlton's "Simple Writing System". I've built, managed, and trained copy teams at six different companies.
