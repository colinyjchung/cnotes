I'll be 100% transparent with you. I can't promise _anything_ when you sign up for **The C-Notes**. You may get random monthly updates, lengthy essays (or ramblings), or nothing at all for stretches of time so long, you'll wonder if I've met an untimely death. 

I have no grand manifesto, no agenda, no overarching "value prop" here. I did that with my last newsletter, _Osmosis_ (2021-2024) and it _burnt me out_. So no weekly rhythm (just because "List Building 101" says so), no last minute pressure to "put content out", no thank you. Just no.

Here's what I _will_ promise you though...

If you're getting an email from me, it's because I wrote something I genuinely, authentically, felt _worth sharing_. It could be thoughts on a book I'm reading, rabbit-hole research I burrowed into, or a single distillation of experience from my 16+ years as a marketer, copywriter, and cofounder. You're free to opt-out _anytime_. In fact, I encourage you to at the top of every email I send you.
