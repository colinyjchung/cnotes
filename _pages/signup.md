I'll be 100% transparent with you. I can't promise _anything_ when you sign up for **The C-Notes**. You may get random monthly updates, long-ass essays (or ramblings), or nothing at all for long stretches of time. I have no grand manifesto, no agenda, no overarching "value prop" here. I did that with my last newsletter, _**Osmosis**_ (2021-2024) and it _burnt me out_. So no weekly rhythm (just because "List Building 101" says so), no last minute pressure to "just put content out", no thank you.

**Here's what I _will_ promise you though:** If you're getting an email from me, it's because I wrote something I genuinely, authentically, felt _worth sharing_. It could be a book I'm reading, research I'm doing, or a single distillation of experience from my 16+ years as a marketer, copywriter, and cofounder. You're free to opt-out _anytime_. In fact, I encourage you to at the top of every email I send you if you're no longer interested.
